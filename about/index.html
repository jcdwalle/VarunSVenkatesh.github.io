			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand and I am passionate about biological research and teaching.
 
During my time in scientific research, I have found a great love for learning about new techniques and developing my knowledge. I also enjoy challenging biological problems irrelevant of the topic.
 
I am currently completing my PhD in Biomedical Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington studying Glioblastoma. During my PhD I have been introduced to a wide variety of techniques and methods,all of which I have optimized or worked with first hand and had to troubleshoot. As such I have developed excellent problem solving skills and a wide base of knowledge.
 
My strengths lie in my enthusiasm to learn new things and pick up concepts rapidly and synergise them with old ideas.</p>
