<div class="about">
<h1>About</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand and I am passionate about biological research and teaching. During my time in scientific research, I have found a great love for learning about new techniques and developing my knowledge.
I also enjoy challenging biological problems irrelevant of the topic. I have recently completed my PhD in Biomedical Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington studying glioblastoma.</p> 
			
<p>During my PhD I was lucky enough to have been introduced to a wide variety of techniques and methods,all of which I have optimized or worked with first hand and had to troubleshoot. 
As such I have developed excellent problem solving skills and a wide base of knowledge. Moreover, I was also able to dabble in side projects otuside of my PhD working on diseases such 
as infantile haemanioma and drug addiction; thus I am also knowledgeable about a number of topics.</p>
	
<p>My strengths lie in my enthusiasm to learn new things and pick up concepts rapidly and synergise them with old ideas.</p>

	<p> In my spare time I am an avid rock climber, trail runner and reader.
