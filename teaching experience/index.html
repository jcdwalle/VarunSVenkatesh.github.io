					<h1>Varun Venkatesh Teaching experience</h1>
					<p>During my PhD I found a love for teaching. I held numerous roles as a teaching assistant in a number of biology courses. These roles included responsibilities ranging from the leading of labs, development of teaching labs and the co-ordination of courses.  My teaching experience and skills has culminated in being offered two short term lecturing fellowship
				 contracts in early 2017 at Victoria University of Wellington. After my strong teaching from 2017, I was invited back to lecture the same 6 lecture course Biology 114 - Neurobiology in 2018.
				In the future I hope to progress my teaching skills and design more integrative and 
						engaging learning experiences for students.</p>
