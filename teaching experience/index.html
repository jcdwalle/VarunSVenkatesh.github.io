					<h1>Varun Venkatesh Teaching experience</h1>
					<p>During my PhD I found a love for teaching. I held numerous roles as a teaching assistant in a number of biology courses. These roles included responsibilities ranging from the leading of labs, development of teaching labs and the co-ordination of courses.  My teaching experience and skills has culminated in being offered two short term lecturing fellowship
				 contracts in early 2017 at Victoria University of Wellington. 
				In the future I hope to progress my teaching skills and design more integrative and 
						engaging learning experiences for students.</p>
